# Netflix-UI-Clone
I have completed a project where I cloned the Netflix UI using only HTML and CSS.
This involved replicating the sleek design, intuitive layout, and responsive elements of Netflix's interface.
Key features include a header navigation bar with the logo and profile icon, a hero section with a featured banner, multiple content rows like "Trending Now" and "Top Picks for You," and interactive hover effects on thumbnails. 
This project enhanced my HTML and CSS skills and provided valuable Frontend web development experience.
